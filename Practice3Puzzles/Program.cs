// See https://aka.ms/new-console-template for more information
Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");

// Write a function that returns "heads" or "tails" depending on the result you get.
static string CoinFlip()
{
    return " ";
}
// Once you have figured out coin flip, take your learning to the next level by creating a dice roller.

// Bonus: Can you rewrite your function to accept a parameter for the number of sides so you can roll any number-sided die?

// write a new function that will roll your dice 4 times and returns a List of those 4 results. 

// Bonus: Write your function to roll any number of times you would like.

// Bonus: After finishing your rolls, print the largest value you rolled.

// Can you take some of the methods you wrote and combine them with what you learned about taking in user input and type casting to create an interactive dice roller? Upon starting the project, a user should be prompted to ask what size of die they would like to roll (6-sided, 12-sided, 20-sided, etc...) and receive a result. Optionally, you can also take input to determine if you would like to roll again or run a different function (like Roll Until). Have fun with it!
